        "&emsp;The Nobel Prize is one of the most established and well-known awards in the scientific field. Since 1901, the Nobel Prize has been awarded 621 times to accomplished people in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine or Physiology, Literature, Peace, and Economic Sciences. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) However, in recent years, there have been many controversies in the pool of nominations and laureates of the Nobel Prize: it was mainly white males working in the elite education and research institutes. Till 2018, only 20 out of 607 medals were awarded to women. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Neikirk et al. focused only on winners in the Physiology and Medicine category and classified them on nationality, gender, and race. The research shows that the nationalities of the majority of the laureates are American. Moreover, black scientists are significantly underrepresented and there is an apparent lack of gender and racial minorities among Nobel laureates. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Furthermore, a study analyzed the institution of the winners who received their Ph.D/MD degree and contributed the majority of their research. It demonstrated that Nobel laureates are primarily associated with elite education and research institutes. <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) From previous studies, it is clear that the Nobel Prize shows significant bias towards scientists based on their nationality, gender, race, and associated institution.\n",
        "\n",
        "&emsp;In 2019, the Nobel Prize committee addressed this issue by announcing that they would try to diversify the pool of nominees in gender, ethnicity, and geography. The academy's secretary-general, biomedical scientist Göran Hansson, said: “It looks like there is a positive trend, with more women being nominated. It's small, but it's a trend… With time, there will also be a gradual change in the population of scientists who are potential candidates, so that will help too.” <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Hansson's opinion is echoed in Mahmoudi et al.'s research. They calculated the likelihood of women winning the Nobel Prize over the years. The results illustrate that there is an overall increase in the percentage of female winners in all categories except Physics. This trend could be related to the rise in women participating in scientific research. Based on reports from the National Science Foundation, between 2011 and 2021, there was a significant increase in the representation of women and underrepresented minorities in the STEM workforce in the United States. <a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) However, the proportion of women in research is still significantly more significant than the percentage of women in Nobel laureates. <a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) It demonstrates the failure of the Nobel Prize committee to accurately reflect and push forward the diversity of the research field in the current day. <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)<br></br>\n",
